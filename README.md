# stylized_todo_list
My attempt to make a stylized todo-list
  This is from the CSS Basics section of "freecodecamp". I changed it from a todo-list to a brewing checklist. I'm uploading it here for two reasons. First I know it still needs work and I know someone might have some insight to help perfect it. Second, I noticed the final passable submission didn't look much of anything like the example. I'm posting what I have so far hoping it might help someone get closer to the example as well.
